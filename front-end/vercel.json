**Why the change?** We are removing the `builds` section. We will configure this in the Vercel UI instead. The `/api` rewrite is still crucial to direct traffic to your backend.

#### Step 2: Configure the Build Settings in the Vercel Dashboard

This is the most important step.

1.  Go to your project on the **Vercel Dashboard**.
2.  Click on the **"Settings"** tab.
3.  Under **"General"**, find the **"Build & Development Settings"** section.

4.  **Framework Preset**: Make sure it is set to **Vite**.

5.  **Build Command**:
    * Click the toggle to **"Override"** the default command.
    * In the text box, enter this exact command:
        ```
        npm run build --prefix frontend
        ```
        (The `--prefix frontend` part is the key. It tells npm to run the `build` script from inside the `frontend` folder).

6.  **Output Directory**:
    * Click the toggle to **"Override"** the default setting.
    * In the text box, enter this exact path:
        ```
        frontend/dist
        ```
        (This tells Vercel where to find the final build files).

7.  **Install Command**:
    * Click the toggle to **"Override"**.
    * Enter this command:
        ```
        npm install --prefix frontend && npm install --prefix back-end
